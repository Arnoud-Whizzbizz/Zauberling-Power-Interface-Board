# Zauberling - Power and Interface board
#
This universal power supply pcb can be used in the 3D printed 'Silberlings' and will be used for my project Zauberling v0.2 overhere on GitHub.

It provides 3.3v to the external I2C bus, 5v and 9v for the main pcb (with an Atmega328P 5V 16Mhz board) and passes trough the 9v from the sides of the module. 
This voltage will be automatically switched to the external power that may be connected on the back of the module.

This is a work in progress, but eventually I'll publish the latest versions of the Gerber files of the universal power and interface pcb overhere.
